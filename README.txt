Saryn's Culture Overhaul

This mod diversifies the cultures of Calradia down to the regional level. It adds new cultures for regions parts of the map, turning each of the factions into a multicultural more true-to-life empire.

Each of the cultures is playable. They may or may not have different traits from their baseline culture based on region and what I thought made some sense.

Each culture also has a slightly varying troop tree from the baseline troop tree. You'll need to explore the map to see all of the varying different options.
I also re-balanced a lot of the troop tree options to buff (hopefully) the factions that spawn in the center of the map. This includes tweaks to the baseline troop cultures.

Cultures

1. Aserai
	1.1 Aserai (id=aserai, vanilla edited)
		- Fairly close to baseline Aserai thematically. Increased number of mariner units because of their proximity to the Jade Sea. No Mameluke units (those have been moved to the Sarranai culture)
		- Location: Quyaz, Sanala, and Qasira, and the surrounding castles and villages.
	1.2 Sarranai (id=aserai2, custom new)
		- Eastern side of the Aeserai lands, and the culture that (in my modded version of history) eventually supercedes the Asearai as the dominant culture and forms the Sarranid Sultanate.
		- Mameluke units as regular troops. A cultural difference between them and the Aeserai is that they use slave soldiers. Noble line is the same as the Aeserai noble line.
		- Location: Razih and Husn Fulq, and some surrounding castles and villages.
	1.3 Nahasawi (id=aserai3, custom new)
		- Southern, desert-dwelling Aeserai clans. Lots of horses and camel riders. Horse archer noble line.
		- Location: Askar, Iyakis, Hubyar, adn the surrounding castles and villages.
2. Battania
	2.1 Battanian (id=battania, vanilla edited)
		- Core of the Battanian lands, and very similar troop tree to vanilla, but I added regular archers. If the Battanians are masters of archery, they shouldn't have to rely on the noble line to provide them.
		- Location: Marunath, Pen Cannoc, Dunglanys, and Seonon, and surrounding castles and villages.
	2.2 Argadian (id=battania2, custom new)
		- Battanian clans that live along the Argad Bay. This is where you can find Battanian mariner units.
		- Location: Car Banseth, and surrounding castles and villages.
3. Empire
	3.1. Calradic (id=empire, vanilla edited)
		- The most populous and dominant culture on the continent, populating the imperial heartlands. Their population is split between the three empires. Troop tree is very close to vanilla imperial tree, but with some changes to equipment.
		- Location: Jalmyris, Amitatys, Zeonica, Poros, Lycaron, Saneopa, Phycaon, Onira, and surrounding castles and villages.
	3.2. Rhotic (id=empire2, custom new)
		- The imperials making up a significant population of the western empire. Because Vlandia canonically was once part of the Empire and broke away, I am choosing to draw an etymological link between "Rhotae" and "Rhodok", one of the vlandian cultures.
		- This means that this culture is sort of genetically close to vlandia but culturally imperial.
		- This is also the only empire culture that has access to the crossbow.
		- Location: Rhotae, Ortysia, and some surrounding castles and villages.
	3.3 Battanic (id=empire3, custom new)
		- The Battanic imperials are imperial citizens in the part of the western empire that were only recently conquered by the Western Empire. They share a cultural heritage, of course, with the nearby Battanians.
		- Location: Lageta, and some surrounding territories.
	3.4 Dryatic (id=empire4, custom new)
		- The Dryatics are the dominant culture of the northern empire, who would prefer the senate rule rather than all the power be concentrated into another emperor. They are a hearty, seafaring people that inhabit the shores of Lake Laconis.
		- Higher number of mariner units, including a mariner archer.
		- Location: Epicrotea, Diathema, Argoron and some surrounding territories.
	3.5 Tanaseatic (id=empire5, custom new)
		- The Tanaseatic imperials have long had context with the steppe folk on the otherside of the Tanaseatic Sea, and have picked up some of their horse archery techniques.
		- Location: Amprela, Myzea, Syronea, and some surrounding territory.
	3.6 Calseadic (id=empire6, custom new)
		- Imperials surrounding the Calsea, in the south near the border with the Aserai. Their noble line have picked up some throwing skills by culture-blending with the Sarranai culture.
		- Location: Danustica, Vostrum, and surrounding territory
4. Khuzait
	4.1 Khuzait (id=khuzait, vanilla edited)
		- Fairly close to vanilla, but with some tweaks.
		- Location: Makeb, Chaikand, Ortongard, and the surrounding territories.
	4.2 Khergit (id=khuzait2, custom new)
		- The eventual inheritors of the Khanate. Their noble line has a lancer unit rather than a horse archer.
		- Location: Odokh, Akkalat, and surrounding territory.
	4.3 Iltanlar (id=khuzait3, custom new)
		- A steppe tribe that has long inhabited the region betweeen Mount Iltan and the Sulan Dag mountains. Split between the Khuzait and the Sturgians. Based on the Magyars. Ethnically sturgian with a lot of aspects that are affected by steppe cultures.
		- Location: Baltakhand, Tyal, and the surrounding territories.
5. Nord
	5.1 Nord (id=nord, vanilla edited)
		- Very similar to vanilla, but I cleaned up some of the weird blurriness between some of the tier 5 units, so each serves a more specific function.
		- Location: Hvalvik, Gretysfjord, Thronderlag, and the surrounding castles and towns.
	5.2 Jumnelander (id=nord2, custom new)
		- The inhabitants of the Jumne valley swear fealty to the Nord kings, but their long-time inhabitants of lands not near the sea means they have culturally blended with the steppe peoples to the south.
		- Not all units are mariners, do have access to horses.
		- Location: Hargard and the surrounding castles and villages along the river.
6. Sturgia
	6.1 Sturgian (id=sturgia, vanilla edited)
		- Similar to vanilla, but buffed some of their units and made more of them mariners, as they are still kin to the nords, and the Rus on which they are based certainly did not forget their nordic roots.
		- Location: Balgard, Sibyr, Varnapol, Omor, and the surrounding castles and villages.
	6.2 Vagir (id=sturgia2, custom new)
		- The Vagir are the hardy, mountain-dwelling warriors of the Sturgians, who have picked up some aspects of the nearby Battanian culture. Their noble line is an infantry similar to the nord huscarl, but without being a mariner. Just a giant tank.
		- Location: Varcheg, Revyl, and the surrounding territories.
		- Note: This required shuffling around a lot of the Sturgian clans' territory to make sure that the Vagiroving actually had some of the Vagir territory.
7. Vlandia
	7.1 Swadian (id=vlandia, vanilla edited)
		- The horse lords of the vlandian kingdom. Pretty typical vlandia stuff, except they don't have crossbows. (In this modded setting, they're a Rhodok/Rhotic exclusive that hasn't yet been picked up by any of the other cultures.)
		- Location: Pravend, Ocs Hall, Rovalt, Ostican, and the surrounding territories.
	7.2 Rhodok (id=vlandia2, custom new)
		- The Rhodok culture, inventors of the crossbow and the dominant force in the southwest of Calradia.
		- Location: Galend, Jaculan, Sargot, Charas, and the surrounding territories.



NOTES ON ADDING A NEW CULTURE

1. Create a new culture file in <SPCultures>. Copy it from one of the vanilla factions and leave a lot of aspects of it alone for now.
2. Create data files for the XML data for all of the different aspects of the culture.
	- BodyProperties
	- EquipmentRosters
	- NPCCharacters (Troops, Lords, Wanderers, and Notables. Education Temlates for kids. )
	- PartyTemplates
	- Heroes
	- Factions (This is the designation that the game uses for clans)
	- Kingdoms (If you desire for there to be a kingdom for your culture; this mod doesn't add new kingdoms)
	- GameText
3. Create SpriteData entries for the new culture in the GUI folder
4. Copy the CharacterCreation.xml to your own mods GUI/Brushes folder and add the new culture as options
5. Include a file for UI charactercreation in the AssetSources/GauntletUI folder. (Or copy ui_charactercreation_vanilla.dds from this mod)
6. Include harmony patch(s) to load the new culture into the game
	- CharacterCreationCampaignBehavior
	- CharacterCreationCultureStageVM
	- LordConversationsCampaignBehavior
7. Add code in the base module to load the sprite data for each culture
